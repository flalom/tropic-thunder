    description: 'TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.\n' +
    'TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[5] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.\n' +
    'There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,[6] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.[7]\n' +
    'TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.[8]\n' +
    'The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\n' +
    'TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages.[9] An official extension allows Visual Studio 2012 to support TypeScript as well.[10]\n' +
    'Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.',
    description2: 'History\n' +
    'TypeScript was first made public in October 2012 (at version 0.8), after two years of internal development at Microsoft.[15][16] Soon after the announcement, Miguel de Icaza praised the language itself, but criticized the lack of mature IDE support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was not available on Linux and OS X at that time.[17][18] Today there is support in other IDEs, particularly in Eclipse, via a plug-in contributed by Palantir Technologies.[19][20] Various text editors, including Emacs, Vim, Sublime, Webstorm, Atom[21] and Microsoft\'s own Visual Studio Code also support TypeScript.[22]\n' +
    'TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics.[23] TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft\'s Build developer conference in 2014.[24] Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provides built-in support for TypeScript.[25]\n' +
    'In July 2014, the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, claiming 5× performance gains. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub.[26]\n' +
    'On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released; it introduced several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally prevent variables from being assigned null values,[27] sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake.\n' +
    'Design\n' +
    'TypeScript originated from the shortcomings of JavaScript for the development of large-scale applications both at Microsoft and among their external customers.[28] Challenges with dealing with complex JavaScript code led to demand for custom tooling to ease developing of components in the language.[29]\n' +
    'TypeScript developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the standard and its cross-platform support. Knowing that the current ECMAScript standard proposal promised future support for class-based programming, TypeScript was based on that proposal. That led to a JavaScript compiler with a set of syntactical language extensions, a superset based on the proposal, that transforms the extensions into regular JavaScript. In this sense TypeScript was a preview of what to expect of ECMAScript 2015. A unique aspect not in the proposal, but added to TypeScript, is optional static typing[30] that enables static language analysis, which facilitates tooling and IDE support.\n' +
    'ECMAScript 2015 support\n' +
    'Main article: ECMAScript § 6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015\n' +
    'TypeScript adds support for features such as classes, modules, and an arrow function syntax as defined in the ECMAScript 2015 standard.\n' +
    'Features\n' +
    'TypeScript is a language extension that adds features to ECMAScript 6. Additional features include:\n' +
    'Type annotations and compile-time type checking\n' +
    'Type inference\n' +
    'Type erasure\n' +
    'Interfaces\n' +
    'Enumerated types\n' +
    'Generics\n' +
    'Namespaces\n' +
    'Tuples\n' +
    'Async/await\n' +
    'The following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015:\n' +
    'Classes\n' +
    'Modules[31]\n' +
    'Abbreviated "arrow" syntax for anonymous functions\n' +
    'Optional parameters and default parameters\n' +
    'Syntactically, TypeScript is very similar to JScript .NET, another Microsoft implementation of the ECMA-262 language standard that added support for static typing and classical object-oriented language features such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and namespaces.\n' +
    'Compatibility with JavaScript\n' +
    'TypeScript is a strict superset of ECMAScript 2015, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript.[32] As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. By default the compiler targets ECMAScript 5, the current prevailing standard, but is also able to generate constructs used in ECMAScript 3 or 2015.\n' +
    'With TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript.[33] Type declarations for these libraries are provided with the source code.\n' +
    'Type annotations\n' +
    'TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time. This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic typing of JavaScript.\n' +
    'function add(left: number, right: number): number {\n' +
    '\treturn left + right;\n' +
    '}\n' +
    'The annotations for the primitive types are number, boolean and string. Weakly- or dynamically-typed structures are of type any.\n' +
    'Type annotations can be exported to a separate declarations file to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for Node.js and jQuery.\n' +
    'The TypeScript compiler makes use of type inference to infer types when types are not given. For example, the add method in the code above would be inferred as returning a number even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of left and right being numbers, and the compiler\'s knowledge that the result of adding two numbers is always a number. However, explicitly declaring the return type allows the compiler to verify correctness.\n' +
    'If no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations, then it defaults to the dynamic any type. A value of the any type supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed for operations on any values.[34]\n' +
    'Declaration files\n' +
    'When a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a declaration file (with the extension .d.ts) that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript.\n' +
    'The concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of header file found in C/C++.\n' +
    'declare namespace arithmetics {\n' +
    '    add(left: number, right: number): number;\n' +
    '    subtract(left: number, right: number): number;\n' +
    '    multiply(left: number, right: number): number;\n' +
    '    divide(left: number, right: number): number;\n' +
    '}\n' +
    'Type declaration files can be written by hand for existing JavaScript libraries, as has been done for jQuery and Node.js.\n' +
    'Large collections of declaration files for popular JavaScript libraries are hosted on GitHub in DefinitelyTyped.\n' +
    'Classes\n' +
    'TypeScript supports ECMAScript 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support.\n' +
    'class Person {\n' +
    '    private name: string;\n' +
    '    private age: number;\n' +
    '    private salary: number;\n' +
    '    constructor(name: string, age: number, salary: number) {\n' +
    '        this.name = name;\n' +
    '        this.age = age;\n' +
    '        this.salary = salary;\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '    toString(): string {\n' +
    '        return `${this.name} (${this.age}) (${this.salary})`; // As of version 1.4\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '}\n' +
    'Generics\n' +
    'TypeScript supports generic programming.[35]\n' +
    'function doSomething<T>(arg: T): T {\n' +
    '    return arg;\n' +
    '}\n' +
    'Modules and namespaces\n' +
    'TypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) utilize immediately-invoked function expression of JavaScript to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) leverage JavaScript library patterns to do so (AMD or CommonJS).[36]\n' +
    'Development tools\n' +
    'Compiler\n' +
    'The TypeScript compiler, named tsc, is written in TypeScript. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a Node.js package that uses Node.js as a host.\n' +
    'There is also an alpha version of a client-side compiler in JavaScript, which executes TypeScript code on the fly, upon page load.[37]\n' +
    'The current version of the compiler supports ECMAScript 5 by default. An option is allowed to target ECMAScript 2015 to make use of language features exclusive to that version (e.g. generators). Classes, despite being part of the ECMAScript 2015 standard, are available in both modes.\n' +
    'IDE and editor support\n' +
    'Microsoft provides a plug-in for Visual Studio 2012 and WebMatrix, full integrated support in Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2015, and basic text editor support for Sublime Text, Emacs and Vim.[38]\n' +
    'Visual Studio Code is a (mostly) open-source, cross-platform source code editor developed by Microsoft based on Electron. It supports TypeScript in addition to several other languages, and offers features like debugging and intelligent code completion.\n' +
    'alm.tools is an open source cloud IDE for TypeScript built using TypeScript, ReactJS and TypeStyle.\n' +
    'JetBrains supports TypeScript with code completion, refactoring and debugging in its IDEs built on IntelliJ platform, such as PhpStorm 6, WebStorm 6, and IntelliJ IDEA,[39] as well as their Visual Studio Add-in and extension, ReSharper 8.1.[40]\n' +
    'Atom has a TypeScript Plugin by Basarat with support for code completion, navigation, formatting, and fast compilation.\n' +
    'The online Cloud9 IDE and Codenvy support TypeScript.\n' +
    'A plugin is available for the NetBeans IDE.\n' +
    'A plugin is available for the Eclipse IDE (version Kepler)\n' +
    'TypEcs is available for the Eclipse IDE.\n' +
    'Microsoft provides a TypeScript Plugin for Sublime Text.\n' +
    'The Cross Platform Cloud IDE Codeanywhere supports TypeScript.\n' +
    'Webclipse An Eclipse plugin designed to develop TypeScript and Angular 2.\n' +
    'Angular IDE A standalone IDE available via npm to develop TypeScript and Angular 2 applications, with integrated terminal support.\n' +
    'Tide – TypeScript Interactive Development Environment for Emacs.\n' +
    'Tsuquyomi - a Vim plugin which uses TSServer and provides features like code completion, navigation and syntax and semantic error checking.\n' +
    'Integration with build automation tools\n' +
    'Using plug-ins, TypeScript can be integrated with build automation tools, including Grunt (grunt-ts[41]), Apache Maven (TypeScript Maven Plugin[42]), Gulp (gulp-typescript[43]) and Gradle (TypeScript Gradle Plugin[44]).\n' +
    'Linting tools\n' +
    'TSLint[45] scans TypeScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. ESLint, a standard JavaScript linter, also provided some support for TypeScript via community plugins. However, ESLint\'s inability to leverage TypeScript\'s language services precluded certain forms of semantic linting and program-wide analysis.[46] In early 2019, the TSLint team announced the linter\'s deprecation in favor of typescript-eslint, a joint effort of the TSLint, ESLint and TypeScript teams to consolidate linting under the ESLint umbrella for improved performance, community unity and developer accessibility.[47]\n' +

    description: 'Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is an open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.[10] It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and Netguru[11].',

    'Features\n' +
    'Components\n' +
    'Vue components extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vue’s compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined options.[14] The code snippet below contains an example of a Vue component. The component presents a button and prints the number of times the button is clicked:\n' +
'<div id="tuto">\n' +
    '\t<button-clicked v-bind:initial-count="0"></button-clicked>\n' +
    '</div>\n' +
'<script>\n' +
    'Vue.component(\'button-clicked\', {\n' +
    '  props: [ "initialCount" ],\n' +
    '  data: () => ({\n' +
    '    count: 0,\n' +
    '  }),\n' +
    '  template: `<button v-on:click="onClick">Clicked {{ count }} times</button>`,\n' +
    '  computed: {\n' +
    '    countTimesTwo() {\n' +
    '      return this.count * 2;\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  },\n' +
    '  watch: {\n' +
    '    count(newValue, oldValue) {\n' +
    '      console.log(`The value of count is changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}.`);\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  },\n' +
    '  methods: {\n' +
    '    onClick() {\n' +
    '        this.count += 1;\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  },\n' +
    '  mounted() {\n' +
    '    this.count = this.initialCount;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '});\n' +
'new Vue({\n' +
    '  el: \'#tuto\',\n' +
    '});\n' +
    '</script>\n' +
    'Templates\n' +
    'Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows binding the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance\'s data. All Vue templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specification-compliant browsers and HTML parsers. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM render functions. A virtual Document Object Model (or “DOM”) allows Vue to render components in its memory before updating the browser. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to calculate the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.\n' +
'Vue users can use template syntax or choose to directly write render functions using JSX.[15] Render functions allow application to be built from software components.[16]\n' +
'Reactivity\n' +
    'Vue features a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to re-render, and which components to re-render.[17]\n' +
'Transitions\n' +
    'Vue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. This includes tools to:\n' +
'Automatically apply classes for CSS transitions and animations\n' +
    'Integrate third-party CSS animation libraries, such as Animate.css\n' +
    'Use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks\n' +
    'Integrate third-party JavaScript animation libraries, such as Velocity.js\n' +
    'When an element wrapped in a transition component is inserted or removed, this is what happens:\n' +
'Vue will automatically sniff whether the target element has CSS transitions or animations applied. If it does, CSS transition classes will be added/removed at appropriate timings.\n' +
    'If the transition component provided JavaScript hooks, these hooks will be called at appropriate timings.\n' +
    'If no CSS transitions/animations are detected and no JavaScript hooks are provided, the DOM operations for insertion and/or removal will be executed immediately on next frame.[18][19]\n' +
    'Routing\n' +
    'A traditional disadvantage of single-page applications (SPAs) is the inability to share links to the exact "sub" page within a specific web page. Because SPAs serve their users only one URL-based response from the server (it typically serves index.html or index.vue), bookmarking certain screens or sharing links to specific sections is normally difficult if not impossible. To solve this problem, many client-side routers delimit their dynamic URLs with a "hashbang" (#!), e.g. page.com/#!/. However, with HTML5 most modern browsers support routing without hashbangs.\n' +
'Vue provides an interface to change what is displayed on the page based on the current URL path -- regardless of how it was changed (whether by emailed link, refresh, or in-page links). Additionally, using a front-end router allows for the intentional transition of the browser path when certain browser events (i.e. clicks) occur on buttons or links. Vue itself doesn’t come with front-end hashed routing. But the open source "vue-router" package provides an API to update the application\'s URL, supports the back button (navigating history), and email password resets or email verification links with authentication URL parameters. It supports mapping nested routes to nested components and offers fine-grained transition control. With Vue, developers are already composing applications with small building blocks building larger components. With vue-router added to the mix, components must merely be mapped to the routes they belong to, and parent/root routes must indicate where children should render.[20]\n' +

    'Which will render in the User component defined in (const User...)\n' +
    'Allows the User component to pass in the particular id of the user which was typed into the URL using the $route object\'s params key: $route.params.id.\n' +
    'This template (varying by the params passed into the router) will be rendered into <router-view></router-view> inside the DOM\'s div#app.\n' +
    'The finally generated HTML for someone typing in: websitename.com/user/1 will be:\n' +
